            <p>Fellow Pirates was my first introduction to the Unity game engine. This project was developed in collaboration with 3 other students over the course of 3 weeks for a videogame design course i took in December 2025. I largely managed the project, and designed both the structure of the codebase, and the layout of the overworld in the game.</p>
