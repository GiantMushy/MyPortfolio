This project was developed in collaboration with 3 other students over the course of 3 weeks for a videogame design course i took in December 2025. I largely managed the project, and designed both the structure of the codebase, and the layout of the overworld in the game.</p>

        <p>My first ever programming project was NanAir. Made entirely in Python with no additional imports, this was an airline database manager where you can create, delete, edit and store all the data an airline may need. This included data about employees, air planes, pilots, destinations, flight schedules and more. To this day I am incredibly proud of this project, as it was the only hand in that got a perfect score that semester (out of 200+ students). This took me 3 weeks to complete, in collaboration with 3 other students. I was solely in charge of the GUI, both for design and implementation of it, while another student focused on the backend, and the other 2 were bug-testing.</p>

        <p>During the fall semester of 2024, I had the opportunity to work with Pygame and OpenGL to create my own engine in a Computer Graphics course. This is where my love of programming really came to light, and was the first time I would genuinely look forward to working on a school project instead of playing videogames or watch YouTube.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first project in this course was a 2D game, inspirationally named Naascar. The assignment was just to make a block breaker, but I took it a bit further. Since the only requirement was to implement the “bouncing off the wall” mechanic, I decided to use this as the wall collision in a two player racing game. It turned out to be a fun and interesting new mechanic to an otherwise overdone style of racing games.</p>

            <p>The Second project in this course was a 3D game. I had to recreate the engine, but decided to continue with the racing idea, and thus Naascar 3D was born. This time implementing a ghost car that drives smoothly through the course with the player using Bezier curve calculations. I also created a DFS algorithm to auto-generate a new track for every game. Im increadibly proud of this one, although the lighting could be a bit better.</p>

I was in charge of general structure and design of the site, as well as implementing the Virtual CV section and the application process. I remembered it being a lot sleeker looking than it actualy is, but for a first attempt, I think it's pretty good :)</p>

    <div class="project-text">
        <p>Since January 2025, I have been TA alongside my studies at Reykjavik University. What started as a side-gig has turned into an incredibly fruitful and inspiring venture. Teaching has given me valuable insight into my own learning technics and shown me the value of not only helping others, but of receiving help when you need it. I have struggled in the past with asking for help, preferring to just muscle my way through anything I might be struggling with alone. But being a teacher, and seeing students struggle in that very same way, has shown me the flaw in that way of thinking. Being able to help others get past this mindset has allowed me do the exact same. And getting them to engage with the material is one of the most enjoyable things I currently get to experience in life.</p>
